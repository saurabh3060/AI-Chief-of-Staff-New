tests/chatbot/test_build_context.py
======================================
Unit tests for the lossless cleaning stage of chatbot.retriever.build_context:
headers, separators, signatures, address blocks and quoted repeats are removed,
and nothing else is rewritten.

The sample threads below deliberately contain:
  * repeated quoted reply history (the same paragraph across all 3 threads)
  * header lines (From/Sent/To/Subject/Date), separators, signatures and
    an address block, which must all be stripped
so the test can assert the output is compact, header-free and dedup-free and
still includes content from every thread.
