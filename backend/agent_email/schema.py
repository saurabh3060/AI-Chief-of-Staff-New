========================
Pydantic models for the Email & Summary agent.
 
Stores the shapes used to represent:
- `EmailMessage`: a normalized view of a single Graph API mail message.
- `ParsedAttachment`: an attachment plus its OCR-extracted text (if it
  was a supported document/image type).
- `ConversationThread`: the set of messages considered part of one
  "conversation" (in this simple pass, all messages sharing the same
  `conversation_key`, most recent N from the inbox).
- `EmailSummary`: the LLM-generated summary for a conversation, plus the
  action-item-relevant text extracted from it - this is what the Action
  & Follow-up Tracker agent reads via `agent_email.service`.
 
Internal to this agent's routes/service - other packages must go
through `agent_email.service` functions, not import these models to
reach into Email agent internals directly (except for the shared
`EmailSummary`/`ActionCandidate` shape that Action Tracker legitimately
consumes as this agent's public output).
