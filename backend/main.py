=======
Application entrypoint for the RBL Bank Digital Office backend.

Responsible for:
- Creating the FastAPI app instance.
- Wiring up startup/shutdown hooks (logging setup).
- Registering every agent's router plus the auth and chatbot routers.
- Exposing a lightweight `/health` endpoint used for smoke checks.

Run locally with:
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8516

# Comment-only change used to verify the Git push/pull workflow; no runtime effect.
# Second sync check: this line round-trips between the dev PC and the server.
# Generic remark: keep this entrypoint focused on application wiring.
# Generic remark: prefer placing business rules inside feature modules.
# Generic remark: startup hooks should stay observable and non-fatal where possible.

# Router registration and the single authentication gate.
#
# Every authenticated router below is mounted with
# `dependencies=[Depends(require_session)]`. FastAPI evaluates a router's
# dependencies BEFORE the matched endpoint's own parameters/body and before
# its handler body runs, so this one line protects every current AND future
# endpoint on that router: a missing/invalid/expired `rbl_session` cookie is
# rejected with 401 before any DB lookup or business logic executes (this is
# what fixes the "fake itemId returns 404 instead of 401" finding - the auth
# dependency now runs ahead of the itemId lookup). Adding a new route to any
# of these routers inherits the gate automatically; there is no per-endpoint
# check to forget.
#
# `require_session` is a no-op in app_only/local mode (see auth/dependencies),
# so this does NOT change behaviour for app-only deployments or the smoke
# suite - it only enforces in delegated mode, which is the deployed posture
# the VAPT retest targeted.
#
# PUBLIC routes are deliberately NOT gated and are listed explicitly:
#   - GET /health, GET /health/storage      (app-level, defined above)
#   - GET /, GET /docs, GET /redoc, /openapi (app-level, defined above)
#   - the entire auth router (/auth/login, /auth/me, /auth/logout,
#     /auth/config) and the prefix-less /callback - these MUST stay reachable
#     pre-login or the sign-in flow itself breaks.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Delegated OAuth routes (/auth/login, /auth/me, /auth/logout) plus the
# prefix-less /callback the Azure app registration redirects to. Always
