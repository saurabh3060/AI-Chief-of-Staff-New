"""
scripts/wipe_all_data.py
========================
DESTRUCTIVE maintenance script — removes ALL of this project's data from
every storage layer:

* PostgreSQL  — TRUNCATE every table this app owns (RESTART IDENTITY), so
                row data and sequences are reset. The tables themselves are
                left in place (the companion ``rebuild_all.py`` / app
                startup recreate/verify schema anyway).
* Vectors     — the email agent's vector store, backend-aware (follows
                ``VECTOR_STORE_BACKEND``):
                  - weaviate: DELETE this project's owned collections
                    entirely, dropping their objects AND schema/vector
                    indexes. Only collections whose names match this
                    project's prefix are touched; a shared Weaviate server's
                    other classes are never deleted (same gated primitive as
                    weaviate_admin.py).
                  - faiss: CLEAR the local on-disk FAISS indexes for the
                    owned namespaces (objects removed, empty index files
                    kept).
                The chatbot's own collection is always a Weaviate collection
                regardless of the email backend, so it is dropped separately
                (best-effort — skipped if Weaviate is unreachable).
* Redis       — scoped flush of every key under this app's key prefix
                (``clear_all_scoped``). Never ``FLUSHDB``/``FLUSHALL``, so a
                shared Redis instance keeps every other project's keys.

This is hard to reverse: PostgreSQL is the system of record, so once it is
truncated the only way back is to re-run the mailbox pipeline
(``run_pipeline.py``). Because of that, the script is DRY-RUN by default
and makes NO changes unless you pass ``--confirm``.

Usage (run from the backend/ directory, venv active)
----------------------------------------------------
    # Dry run — prints exactly what WOULD be wiped, changes nothing:
    python scripts/wipe_all_data.py

    # Actually wipe everything (all three layers):
    python scripts/wipe_all_data.py --confirm

    # Limit to specific layers (vector layer named "vectors"; "weaviate"
    # and "faiss" are accepted as aliases):
    python scripts/wipe_all_data.py --confirm --only postgres,redis
    python scripts/wipe_all_data.py --confirm --only vectors

Exit code 0 on success (including a clean dry-run), non-zero on error.
