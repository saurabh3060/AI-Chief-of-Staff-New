"""
core/logging_config.py
========================
Centralised logging setup for the entire backend.

Design goals (per project requirements):
- One rotating `.log` file per agent (and per core client) inside a single
  `logs/` folder, so operators can tail exactly the component they care
  about.
- The console is quiet: only WARNING and above are printed to stdout, so
  routine request handling never spams the terminal.
- Log files capture INFO and above, but callers are expected to avoid
  logging routine "200 OK" completions - only meaningful events (request
  context, decisions, retries, errors) should be logged. This module
  provides a `log_request_outcome()` helper that enforces that policy in
  one place instead of leaving it to each call site's discipline.

Usage:
    from core.logging_config import setup_logging, get_agent_logger

    setup_logging()  # call once, at process startup
    logger = get_agent_logger("agent_email")
    logger.info("Fetched %d messages", count)
